This repository provides codes, data, and step-by-step manuals for a project completed in Remote Sensing Lab at Saint Louis University. 
In this project, we utilize deep learning to investigate forest conversation and deforestation in Madagascar. The work is the first demonstration of using satellite imagery (WorldView-3) as the direct input for forest mapping within a deep learning frmework.
